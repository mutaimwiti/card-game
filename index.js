// We start with the deck of 52 cards, each uniquely numbered from 1 to 53
// The deck is shuffled
// We deal out those cards between the 2 players. Each player gets half the deck.
// On each turn of the game, both players turn over their topmost card, and they compare the value of those cards.
// The player with the higher valued card "wins" the round and gets a point. The two cards being compared are discarded.
// Rounds are played until all the cards are discarded.
// At the end of the game the player who has the most points wins.
//
// Output:
// When each round is played you should print each player's card value along with an indication of which player won that round.
// When all rounds are played you should print each player's final score along with an indication of which player won overall.
